           <b> Computer Science : </b> 
               To put it bluntly, computer engineers make computer parts work together. Computer engineers are responsible for the research, design and development of computer equipment like circuit boards, microchips, routers, video cards, etc. Some universities may treat this discipline as an off-shoot of electrical engineering.

             It is beneficial for computer engineers to have a grasp of computer science. Computer engineers often deal with hardware-to-software integration, meaning they have to design and build processors and hardware that can support a given program.

            <b> Information Techology: </b>
                 Information technology (IT) may adopt the monikers information systems or systems administration. Essentially, IT professionals are the users of technology. IT utilizes existing operating systems, software and applications in tandem to create a larger system that solves a specific business problem. IT constructs a network from established building blocks to carry out a task, such as an automated supplies ordering service.
